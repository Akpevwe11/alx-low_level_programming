# Introduction to Streams in C++ 

## What are C++ streams? 

In C++, a stream refers to a sequence of characters that are transferred between theh program and input/output (I/O) devices. Stream classes in C++ facilitate input and output operations on files and other I/O devices.

These classes have specific fdeatures to handle program input and output, making it easier to write portable code that can be used across multiple platforms.

The term "stream" in C++ is derived from the concept of a continuous flow of data, much like a stream of water. This metaphor captures several key aspects of how data is handled in streams:

1. **Continuous Flow:** Data is processed in a sequential, continuousu manner. Just as water flows from one epoint to another, data flows frorm a source(e.g., a file, the keyboard) to a destination (e.g., theh console, a file).

2. **Abstraction:** Streams abstract the details of the data source and destination. This abstraction allows developers to use a consistent interface for reading and writing data, regardless of the undeelying medium (e.g., files, memory, network).

3. **Flexibility:** Streams can handle different types of data(text, binary, etc.) and different I/O operations (reading, writingn, both). They provide a flexible and uniform way to work with various forms ofinput and output. 

4. **Sequential Access:** Streams typically provide sequential access to data, meaning data is read or written in a specific order, one piece at a time. This is analogous to how water flows in a stream where each drop follows the previous one.


## Examples of the Stream Concept

[-] **Input Stream:**(`std::istream`) Represents a flow of data into the program. The standard input stream  (`std:cin`) reads data from the keyboard, and file input streams (`std::ifstream`) read data from files.

[-] **Output Stream:**(`std::ostream`) Represents a flow of data out of the program. The standard output stream (`std::cout`) writes data to the console, and file output streams (`std::ofstream`) write data to files.
